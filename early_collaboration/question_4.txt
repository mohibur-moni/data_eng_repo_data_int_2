-- Suppose we want to see our inventory. If we have more than 50 unit for a single item, we want to give a discount (25%) on unit price, 
whereas if its less than 50 then then we should increase the price like discount. But when we have no stock on a single item, we want to increase price nearly 35%.
First check the stock then chnage the price with product if and name.


create temp table product_status as
SELECT
	productid,
	productname,
	CASE
		WHEN unitsinstock < 50 and unitsinstock > 0 THEN
			'less stock'
		WHEN unitsinstock > 50 then 'over stock'

		END product_status
